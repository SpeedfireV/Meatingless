# OrderIn

## Description

**OrderIn** is a small demo app which briefly showcases my skills in Flutter development. The app focuses on food ordering and includes key features that a fully functional app should have.

### Features:
- **Main Screen**: Add a variety of foods to your order with ease.
- **Search Bar**: Quickly find your favorite foods with the built-in search functionality.
- **Filtering Mechanism**: Helps you find any beverage or food you are looking for based on different filters.
- **Order History**: Keep track of all your past orders, helping you relive those memorable meals.
- **Favorites**: Mark items that you love, so you never forget to order them next time.
